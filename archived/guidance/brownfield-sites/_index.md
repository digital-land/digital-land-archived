The Town and Country Planning (Brownfield Land Register) Regulations 2017 require local planning authorities to maintain a register of their brownfield sites that are suitable for housing. This guidance will help local authorities ensure brownfield land registers are:

* published in the agreed format and contain the required data
* kept up to date
* easily found online

## Make your data findable, usable and trustworthy

Brownfield land is an important part of cost-efficient and sustainable local planning and development. Data on brownfield land has a wide range of current and potential uses, including:

* planning for housing-led development
* creating new digital services
* giving community members insight into local development

But for data to be useful it must be easy to find, use, understand and trust. Local authorities should ensure that their brownfield land data is all of these by following this guidance, which gives a high-level overview of the data format and the publication process.

We’re also developing a tool which you can try out to [check your brownfield site data](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/start). This is not a live service, but a prototype we are testing.


## Publishing brownfield land data: 3 steps

Try to update your register as soon as a new brownfield site is identified or an existing one changes status. Local planning authorities must review their brownfield land register at least once a year but are encouraged to do so as often as possible to ensure the data is up to date, and to give better value to planners and developers. 

Publishing is a 3 step process:

1. Create a brownfield land CSV file
2. Upload each of these files to your organisation’s website and give them a persistent URL, then clearly link to them from your brownfield land web page
3. Update the national brownfield land register on the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) website
