MHCLG will maintain a national register of developer contributions.

The first time you create and publish your 3 CSV files you must tell us where these are published (the persistent URL created in step 2). You must also tell us if this ever changes.

We are currently developing an online tool for you to input your URL. For now, please email the URL(s) to DigitalLand@communities.gov.uk

If have any questions or feedback, you can also email us at DigitalLand@communities.gov.uk
