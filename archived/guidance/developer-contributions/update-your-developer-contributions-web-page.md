To complete step 2 you must be able to upload the files created in step 1 to your local planning authority’s website and edit (or create) your developer contributions web page. If you aren’t able or authorised to do this, speak to someone who is (this might be the person who updates your local planning authority’s brownfield site register or planning application web pages).

Upload each CSV file to your local planning authority's website using a [persistent URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_uniform_resource_locator) (a web address that will not change over time). As an example, Norfolk’s local planning authority might use the following persistent addresses (note that these are examples, not live data):

https://www.norfolk.gov.uk/developer-agreement/developer-agreement_20190101.csv

https://www.norfolk.gov.uk/developer-agreement-contribution/developer-agreement-contribution_20190101.csv

https://www.norfolk.gov.uk/developer-agreement-transaction/developer-agreement-transaction_20190101.csv

https://www.norfolk.gov.uk/developer-agreement-transaction/latest

When you upload the files you should:

* keep your older files online – it’s important to retain a history of all developer contribution files
* make a copy of the new files, rename the copies exactly the same except with ‘latest’ in place of the date, then upload both sets of files

You should then update your local planning authority’s developer contributions web page to make the CSV files publicly available. If your website does not have a page on developer contributions, you or someone in the web team will need to create one. We recommend publishing your developer contributions on the same web page as your authority’s infrastructure funding statement.

The page must list the persistent URLs as defined above. The URLs must be written out in full. (The URL should not change. However, if it ever does change, [you must tell us](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/developer-contributions/update-the-national-register-of-developer-contributions/).)

You must state on this web page that the data is provided under the [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).
